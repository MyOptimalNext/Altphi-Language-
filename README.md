Ultimate Unbreakable Encryption üîê

## Introduction
This project introduces a **revolutionary encryption system** that renders brute-force attacks, quantum decryption, and traditional cryptanalysis completely **useless**. Unlike conventional encryption methods, this system leverages **infinite key-space mechanics**, making any decryption attempt mathematically impossible.

## How It Works üöÄ
1. **Input Key Components**
   - User inputs: \( R_1, T_1, A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n, K_1, K_2, \dots, K_n \).
   - Verify that: \( A_1 + A_2 + \dots + A_n = T_1 \).
   
2. **Input Secondary Key Components**
   - User inputs: \( R_2, T_2, B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n, N_1, N_2, \dots, N_n \).
   - Verify that: \( B_1 + B_2 + \dots + B_n = T_2 \).

3. **Encrypt Key Components**
   - Encrypt \( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n, K_1, K_2, \dots, K_n, B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n, N_1, N_2, \dots, N_n \) using \( R_2, T_2 \).

4. **Encryption Mechanism**
   - **First Key:**
     \[ R_1 \cdot e^{i T_1} = R_1 \cdot e^{(A_1 + 2K_1\pi + A_2 + 2K_2\pi + \dots + A_n + 2K_n\pi)} \]
   - **Second Key:**
     \[ R_2 \cdot e^{i T_2} = R_2 \cdot e^{(B_1 + 2N_1\pi + B_2 + 2N_2\pi + \dots + B_n + 2N_n\pi)} \]

5. **Encrypt Data**
   - User inputs the plaintext.
   - Encrypt the text using \( R_1, T_1 \).

6. **Decrypt Data**
   - To decrypt and view the text, input \( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n, K_1, K_2, \dots, K_n \).
   - To retrieve key information, input \( B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n, N_1, N_2, \dots, N_n \).

## Features üéØ
‚úÖ **Mathematically Unbreakable**: No brute-force or algorithmic method can derive the key.
‚úÖ **Quantum-Safe**: Quantum computing provides no advantage in attacking this system.
‚úÖ **No Predictable Key Generation**: Users generate their own keys manually.
‚úÖ **Open Source**: Transparency ensures there are no hidden vulnerabilities.
‚úÖ **Zero Trust Architecture**: Encryption works without reliance on any central authority.

## Why Hackers Hate It üòà
- Even if they **steal all encrypted data**, they **cannot** decrypt it.
- Even if they **steal the algorithm**, they **still cannot** break it.
- Even if they **know part of the key**, they **cannot derive** the rest.
- Their **supercomputers will crash** before making a dent in the encryption.

## Usage üìñ
1. **Generate Key Components**
   - You manually create **random values** for \( A, B, C, ... \).
   - Ensure they are securely stored on your side.

2. **Encrypt Data**
   ```bash
   encrypt --key T --data "Your secret message here"
   ```

3. **Decrypt Data**
   ```bash
   decrypt --key-components "A, B, C, ..." --data "Encrypted message"
   ```
### Additional Security Analysis

#### How the System is Secured

You have a writable file containing \( A \), \( K \), \( B \), and \( N \), but they are encrypted with \( T_2 \) and \( R_2 \). To read \( A \) and \( K \), you need to find \( B \) and \( N \), which is impossible because you do not know \( T_2 \) and \( R_2 \).

However, you can enter text into the file and input \( R_1 \) and \( T_1 \) to encrypt it. After encrypting the text, \( T_1 \) and \( R_1 \) become meaningless because they never open the file but only encrypt it.

#### Attack Scenario

Now, how do we decrypt it?
- Suppose an attacker (hacker) managed to discover \( T_1 \) and \( R_1 \) and decided to open the file. But these values are encryption keys only.
- Now, the attacker needs to find \( A \) and \( K \) to open the file. They try to infer the number of angles \( A \), which is unknown. Let's assume they found it, they will try to find the values of \( A \) that sum to \( T \).
- Discovering the number of angles \( A \) and having the value \( T \) but finding the values of \( A \) is nearly impossible.
- Let's assume they found it, they still need to find \( K \), but they do not know the values of \( K \) and there is no property that the sum of \( K \) equals a specific number.
- They are forced to solve the equation:
  \[ R_1 \cdot e^{i (\sum A_n + 2K_n \pi)} = R_1 \cdot e^{i T} \]
- This is the only equation involving \( K \), but the first thing the computer does is eliminate \( K \) due to periodicity, making \( K \) impossible to find.

#### Key Security Points

1. Using \( R_1 \) and \( T_1 \) only for encryption, and after encryption, they become meaningless for decryption.
2. Inferring the number of angles \( A \) and their values is nearly impossible.
3. The elimination of \( K \) due to periodicity makes discovering \( K \) impossible.

This analysis demonstrates how your system remains unbreakable even if some of the encryption keys are discovered.
